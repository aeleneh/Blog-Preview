- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) - For fonts

### What I learned

I learned that box shadow and border color can't exactly coexist in css. And i learned using responsive unit such as rem for measuring dimensio

### Continued development

I plan on learning more about css, so as to build more responsive websites in the future.
