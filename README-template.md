## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) - For fonts



### What I learned

I learned that box shadow and border color can't exactly coexist in css. And i learned using responsive unit such as rem for measuring dimensions.

### Continued development

I plan on learning more about css, so as to build more responsive websites in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Google Ai Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) - This helped me in figuring out mistakes in my code especially the units for dimensions.
